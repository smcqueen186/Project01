# Project01 - BugCatcher

This project focuses on a prototype for a test case and defect reporting management system called BugCatcher. BugCatcher was created by a development team specifically for internal use. The application lacks styling and contains many incomplete features, so it is expected to have both visual and logical defects. The goal of this project is to perform E2E testing on the application by writing and executing automation tests. The source code is not accessible, but a version of the application is running in a dev environment where the underlying API for the application is accessible. My responsibility includes fulfilling the intent of every scenario within a feature, and also adding/editing any if needed. The dev header id for this project is dev=20.

Included in this project:
- Requirements Traceability Matrix
- Test Case document
- Defect Reoprt document
